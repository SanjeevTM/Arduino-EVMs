# Arduino-EVMs

With each passing day, our country nears the milestone of surpassing China's record of the highest population recorded. A government in a democratic perspective can be defined as: "For the people, by the people and of the people". However, our country is presently the largest democratic country, which implies we need effective measures of maintaining the transparency of the method by which we elect our representatives. Malpractices and ill-intended procedures have plagued our progress of ballots. About this hot topic, we as a team have decided to represent our claim on EVMs with our limited knowledge. 

The ideology remains simple as the system is provided with "N" the button corresponding to the "N" participants. The voters will be allowed to proceed to choose their preferred candidate from the panel of buttons displayed. An LCD screen to display the voting will be provided as the final results are calculated automatically simply by pressing the result button. We  aim at using Arduino to work on this innovation. In this manner, the process of voting has now become cost-effective and removed the tendency of multiple votes being registered by a single voter.

This repository is solely to maintain the source code of the simple Arduino constructed EVM
